‚ú® Laser Cut/CNC Cost Calculator ‚ú®
------------------------------------
Stop guessing job costs! The Laser Cut/CNC Cost Calculator is a simple yet powerful web tool designed to help you accurately estimate the price of your laser cutting or CNC machining projects. By inputting your machine's speed, operational costs, and uploading your design file (SVG), you can get a quick and reliable budget estimate, perfect for quoting clients or planning your own projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manually calculating the cost of every laser cut or CNC job can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This calculator streamlines the process by taking your specific parameters ‚Äì machine speed, hourly costs, material expenses, and the actual cut paths from your SVG file ‚Äì to generate a detailed cost breakdown. Get the insights you need for accurate budgeting and confident quoting.


üöÄ **Key Features**
--------------------
* üìê **SVG File Upload:** Upload your vector design file (SVG format) for analysis.
* üìè **Automatic Path Calculation:** Intelligently calculates the total cutting length directly from your SVG data.
* ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Estimation:** Determines the estimated machine run time based on total cut length and your specified machine speed.
* üí∞ **Flexible Cost Inputs:** Define crucial cost factors:
    * Machine Hourly Rate (covering depreciation, power, maintenance)
    * Operator/Labor Hourly Rate (optional)
    * Material Cost (e.g., per square meter/foot or per sheet)
* üìä **Detailed Cost Breakdown:** See estimated costs separated into Machine Time, Labor (if applicable), and Material.
* üí≤ **Total Job Cost Estimate:** Get a final estimated cost for the entire job based on your inputs.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use form for quick data entry.


‚öôÔ∏è **Input Parameters Explained**
----------------------------------
1.  **SVG File Upload:**
    * Upload your design in SVG format. The tool analyzes the vector paths within the file to determine the total distance the laser or CNC tool needs to travel.
2.  **Machine Speed:**
    * Enter the average cutting speed your machine will use for this specific material and job. Specify units (e.g., mm/minute, inches/minute). This is crucial for accurate time calculation.
3.  **Machine Hourly Rate:**
    * Input the cost associated with running the machine itself for one hour. This should ideally factor in electricity consumption, machine depreciation or lease costs, routine maintenance, and any consumables directly related to machine operation (excluding the primary material).
4.  **Labor Hourly Rate (Optional):**
    * If operator time needs to be factored into the cost (for setup, supervision, post-processing), enter the hourly wage or rate here. Leave as 0 if not applicable.
5.  **Material Cost:**
    * Specify the cost of the material being used. This might be entered as cost per unit area (e.g., $/m¬≤, $/ft¬≤) or potentially cost per standard sheet size if the calculator supports it. *(Clarify how material cost is handled if possible)*.
6.  **(Optional) Setup Time:**
    * *(Consider adding)* A field to add a fixed amount of time for job setup (loading material, preparing the file, machine calibration) which can be added to the labor cost calculation.


üìä **Calculation Output & Summary**
------------------------------------
After processing your inputs, the calculator provides:

* **Total Cut Length:** The sum of all path lengths extracted from your SVG file.
* **Estimated Machining Time:** Calculated as (Total Cut Length / Machine Speed). *Potential addition: + Setup Time*.
* **Material Cost Estimate:** The calculated cost for the material required for the job based on your input. *(Method depends on implementation - e.g., bounding box area * cost per area)*.
* **Machine Running Cost:** Calculated as (Estimated Machining Time * Machine Hourly Rate).
* **Labor Cost:** Calculated as ((Estimated Machining Time + Setup Time) * Labor Hourly Rate).
* **Total Estimated Job Cost:** The sum of Material Cost + Machine Running Cost + Labor Cost.

ü§î **How It Works**
--------------------
1.  **Upload:** Click the upload button and select the SVG file containing your cut design.
2.  **Input Speeds & Costs:** Fill in the required fields: Machine Speed, Machine Hourly Rate, Material Cost details, and optionally the Labor Hourly Rate (and Setup Time, if available). Ensure units are correct.
3.  **Calculate:** Press the "Calculate Cost" button.
4.  **Review:** Analyze the displayed results, which include the estimated time, a breakdown of costs (Material, Machine, Labor), and the Total Estimated Job Cost.
5.  **(Optional) Adjust:** Modify input parameters (e.g., try a different speed, material, or machine rate) and recalculate to see the impact on the final cost.


üíª **Technology**
------------------
* Built with **React** for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
* Likely utilizes JavaScript libraries for **SVG parsing** to read and calculate path lengths.
* Performs calculations client-side for immediate results.
